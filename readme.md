## About this Project

**The idea of the App is:**

*Let's gamify the traditional education and get one more step toward future*

## Why ?

At first, we should develop a unique function for the project, but we decide to go beyond.
So for one mouth, we learned about Html/CSS 
and decided to create a website instead use only the Prompt.

*If you would like to give us some feedback, here are my contact details.*
